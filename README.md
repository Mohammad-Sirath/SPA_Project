# SPA Project

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. It uses various libraries and tools for efficient development, including Bootstrap for styling, SweetAlert2 for login prompts, and React Router for routing with special handling for nested routes in the _Articles_ page.

## Features

- **Bootstrap for Styling**: The project is styled using the Bootstrap framework, providing a clean, responsive design that looks great on all screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout and components automatically adjust to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **SweetAlert2 for Login**: The login process is handled using SweetAlert2 for a more modern and interactive approach to user authentication prompts.
- **React Router for Routing**: The project uses `react-router-dom` for managing navigation. Special attention is given to the nesting of routes in the _Articles_ page, providing a smooth user flow and seamless page transitions.
- **Temporary Cookies for Login/Logout**: JavaScript is used to manage temporary cookies to track the login and logout status of the user without the need for server-side session management.
